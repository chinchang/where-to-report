# 🐞 Where to Report?

Discovered an issue with a website, app or anything else? Want to report it to the creators but don't know where? Search here.

## Add to List

Found something missing? You can add the reporting link if you know it or simply let me know what's missing. There are 2 ways you can add to the list:

### If you have experience with Github

1. Fork this repo.
2. Edit `_data/list.json` and add the missing item.
3. Open a Pull request.

### If you don't have experience with Github

1. [Open an issue by clicking here](https://github.com/chinchang/where-to-report/issues/new) (You'll need to be login on Github for this).
2. Mention the **Name**, **Link to the item** and **Issue reporting link** in the issue.
3. I'll verify and add it to the list.
